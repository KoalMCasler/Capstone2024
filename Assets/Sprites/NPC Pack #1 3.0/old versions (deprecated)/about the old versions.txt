In April 2022 I completely overhauled the visual style of all my NPCs.
They now have a more consistent look and size, but also fewer frames.
I removed the standing idle pose and some of the animations because I felt they were unecessary for generic NPCs.
However, I am still keeping the old stuff here in case you prefer it and want to use them.

Thanks for understanding!
