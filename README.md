# Te Reo Māori 

*The Māori language*

This is a top-down 2D puzzle game focused on exploring a museum to gather information for a school project!

# Please Read!

We offer this game as a reflection on the rich culture and heritage of the Māori people. While we strive for accuracy and respect, we acknowledge that our interpretations may differ from the experiences and perspectives of others. This game is a tribute to the Māori people and their traditions, as seen through our own lens.

*Koal & Adrian*

We will also acknowledge that this was made in Mi'kma'ki, the ancestral and unceded territory of the Mi'kmaq people. Our relationship is based on a series of Peace and Friendship treaties between the Mi’kmaq Nation and the Crown, dating back to 1725. 
In Nova Scotia, we recognize that we are all treaty people.

The game was programmed and designed by Adrian Dorey and Koal M. Casler.
